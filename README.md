**steps**
First, I make a new repo on github.
Then I go to IDE.
Then I switched directory to github-learning.
Then I use command mkdir to make a directory, which would be my repo.
Then I change directory(cd) to the directory I just made.
Then I use the command touch README.md to make a file where I can write and record in.
Lastly, I type in the command git push (destination) which will update everything in github.# github-learning-repotest
